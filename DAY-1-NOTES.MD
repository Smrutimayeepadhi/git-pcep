* print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
     On above this code, 1st input line of code execute then the control will move to print function to execute.
if you don't know how it's running there is tool named **Thonny(Python IDE for beginners)** you can go through it and download from your browser
* VARIABLES
     Variable is a container which holds value.
e.g: x = 10 Here, x is variable whereas 10 is value
    james = 2837646 james is a variable whereas 2837646 is the value

* random module:
   In programming, a module is a section of code that is added in as a whole 
or is designed for easy reusability.
 e.g if you want to surf something on google, the google algorithm has 
horrendously complicated and it's taken them years and years to be perfect
to give us fine information. whenever we search something it gives for more relevent information that we want
so just like that the python team have made a random module.
